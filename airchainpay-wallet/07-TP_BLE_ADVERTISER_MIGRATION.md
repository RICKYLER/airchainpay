# tp-rn-ble-advertiser Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from `react-native-ble-advertiser` to `tp-rn-ble-advertiser` for improved BLE advertising capabilities in AirChainPay.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Dependencies
- **Removed**: `react-native-ble-advertiser@0.0.17`
- **Added**: `tp-rn-ble-advertiser@5.2.0`

### 2. Source Code Updates

#### BluetoothManager.ts
- Updated import: `import ReactNativeBleAdvertiser from 'tp-rn-ble-advertiser'`
- Changed API calls:
  - Old: `advertiser.broadcast(serviceUUID, manufacturerData, options)`
  - New: `advertiser.startBroadcast(message)`
- Updated method checks:
  - Old: `hasBroadcast` and `hasStopBroadcast`
  - New: `hasStartBroadcast` and `hasStopBroadcast`
- Simplified advertising data format to JSON string

#### BLEAdvertisingEnhancements.ts
- Updated advertising method to use `startBroadcast()` with JSON message
- Simplified configuration to work with the new API

#### BLEAdvertisingSecurity.ts
- Updated secure advertising to use `startBroadcast()` with encrypted JSON message
- Maintained security features while adapting to new API

### 3. Android Configuration
- **Added**: `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE` permission
- **Added**: `RestartReceiver` for background advertising support
- **Location**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

### 4. iOS Configuration
- **Verified**: Existing Bluetooth permissions and background modes are sufficient
- **No changes needed**: iOS Info.plist already has required configurations

## API Differences

### Old API (react-native-ble-advertiser)
```javascript
// Start advertising
await advertiser.broadcast(
  serviceUUID,
  manufacturerData,
  {
    txPowerLevel: -12,
    advertiseMode: 0,
    includeDeviceName: true,
    includeTxPowerLevel: true,
    connectable: true
  }
);

// Stop advertising
await advertiser.stopBroadcast();
```

### New API (tp-rn-ble-advertiser)
```javascript
// Start advertising
const message = JSON.stringify({
  name: deviceName,
  serviceUUID: serviceUUID,
  type: 'AirChainPay',
  version: '1.0.0',
  capabilities: ['payment', 'secure_ble'],
  timestamp: Date.now()
});
await advertiser.startBroadcast(message);

// Stop advertising
await advertiser.stopBroadcast();
```

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Simplified API**: The new advertiser uses a simpler string-based message format
2. **Better Android Support**: More reliable advertising on Android devices
3. **Active Maintenance**: The new package is actively maintained
4. **Improved Reliability**: Better handling of background advertising
5. **Enhanced Features**: Better support for foreground services and boot completion

## Testing

### Migration Verification
Run the test script to verify the migration:
```bash
npm run test-tp-advertiser
```

### Manual Testing
1. Build and run the app on Android: `npm run android`
2. Navigate to BLE Payment screen
3. Test advertising functionality
4. Verify that devices can discover the AirChainPay advertiser

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `package.json` - Updated dependencies
- `src/bluetooth/BluetoothManager.ts` - Updated imports and API calls
- `src/bluetooth/BLEAdvertisingEnhancements.ts` - Updated advertising method
- `src/bluetooth/BLEAdvertisingSecurity.ts` - Updated secure advertising

### Configuration Files
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added permissions and receiver

### Test Files
- `scripts/test-tp-ble-advertiser.js` - Migration verification script

## Next Steps

1. **Test on Device**: Run the app on a physical Android device
2. **Verify Functionality**: Test BLE advertising and scanning
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check for any performance improvements
4. **Update Documentation**: Update any related documentation

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the migration can be rolled back by:
1. Reverting package.json changes
2. Restoring original source code
3. Removing Android manifest additions
4. Running `npm install` to restore original dependencies

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

All migration checks passed successfully. The new tp-rn-ble-advertiser is now integrated and ready for testing.
